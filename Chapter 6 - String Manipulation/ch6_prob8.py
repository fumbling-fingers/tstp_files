quote = """\"The unlucky are nothing more than a frame of reference for the lucky.
You are unlucky, so I may know that I am not. Unfortunately the lucky never
realizes they are lucky until it's too late. Take yourself for instance;
yesterday you were better off than you are off today but it took today for you
to realize it. But today has arrived and it's too late. You see? People are
never happy with what they have. They want what they had, or what someone else
has.\""""
