encapsulation refers to two concepts
------------------------------------

1. objects groups variables (state) and methods (for altering state 
or doing caculations that use state) in a singe unit

2. hides a class's internal data to prevent the CLIENT (code outside
the class that uses the object) from directly accessing it



private variables and private methods
-------------------------------------

variables and methods that objects can access in the code that implements the various methods, but the client cannot.

Private variables are an example of the second concept encapsulation refers to; private variables hide a class's internal data to prevent the client from directly accessing it.
